## About me

Physicist, PhD, maker, tinkerer, scuba diver, father of 2, with an interest in optics, science and technology.\
Just started with Github, learning the ins and outs.

## What I'm currently working at
Python programming for fun, personal desire, or occasional necessity:
- A 2D raytracer, focused on laser light, coherence effects, material surface characteristics
- A genealogy program, that allows generation of a simple tree-structure family tree from familiy members and their connection
- A 2D simulation for demonstrating the ideal gas law
